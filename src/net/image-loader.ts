/**
 * Loading source pixels into something WebGL can sample without tainting.
 *
 * This is the single most failure-prone step in the whole editor, so it is isolated
 * here with an explicit fallback chain.
 *
 * A WebGL context that samples a cross-origin texture becomes *tainted*, and a
 * tainted context makes both `extract.pixels()` (which draws the histogram) and
 * `toBlob()` (which saves the result) throw a SecurityError. On a stock WordPress
 * site uploads are same-origin and none of this matters. On a site using a CDN or a
 * media-offload plugin, uploads come from another host and the naive path breaks --
 * which is precisely the site where the failure would otherwise be discovered by a
 * user, at save time, after they had already done the work.
