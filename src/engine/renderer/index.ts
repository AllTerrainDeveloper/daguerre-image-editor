/**
 * The Pixi-backed render engine.
 *
 * The source texture is always full resolution, but interaction never pays for it.
 * Pixi runs a filter at the *rendered* size of the object it is attached to, and
 * the on-screen sprite is scaled to fit the viewport -- so dragging a slider on a
 * 6000px photograph costs the same as dragging one on a 1200px thumbnail. The
 * viewport is the proxy; there is no second texture to keep in sync.
 *
 * Saving re-runs the identical filter against the unscaled texture. The two agree
 * because every phase-1 op is per-pixel colour maths with no spatial radius, so the
 * result is genuinely resolution-independent. An op with a pixel radius -- blur,
 * sharpen, grain -- would break that and must scale its radius with the render size
 * when those land in a later phase.
 *
 * This module is the facade, and it is deliberately thin. What used to be
 * thirty-five methods on one class is now three groups a caller can be handed
 * separately -- `view`, `paint`, `pixels` -- plus the handful of verbs that act on the
 * engine as a whole.
